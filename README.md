# Unofficial Ender 3 NG v1.2 Issue Tracker

This repository serves to be an open and transparent way to document issues with the Ender 3 NG v1.2.

## What is the Ender 3 NG v1.2?

The Ender 3 NG v1.2 is a modification for the Creality Ender 3 3D printer that converts them to a coreXY format.  It aims to reuse as many parts from the original Ender 3 as practically possible, and is released under the [CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 license](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/).

Here are some links to the project:

## Why have an unofficial issue tracker?

Currently, the official way to file a bug is to use the Google Form located [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfeCF5nFl6-nCHq0bmyJtXvXtZRy99HmWLhWjlfGZtP3Uil4A/viewform).  However, this approach has many problems:

- There is no way to view any issues by any user, even for the issues a user has filed.
- There is no way to search any issues for known problems.
- There is no community engagement for any issue, even if a user has a known fix or workaround.
- There is no way to know that the author has acknowledged any issue.
- There is no feedback from any filed issues to anyone, so it is not possible to know that an issue has been fixed.
- There is no way to provide updates to any issue as a user, even issues that the user has filed.

This unofficial repository solves all the above problems and more.

## Will the author see my issue?

After filing an issue here, please include a link to your issue to the author via [the Google Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfeCF5nFl6-nCHq0bmyJtXvXtZRy99HmWLhWjlfGZtP3Uil4A/viewform).  This will inform them of the issue with their preferred tool, while still maintaining the transparency and collaboration of GitHub issues.

## Shouldn't the author own this issue tracker?

I would love them to!  If they reach out, I will happily transfer this repository to the author of the Ender 3 NG v1.2 project.
